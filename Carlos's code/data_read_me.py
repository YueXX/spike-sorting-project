# a file explain the code 


# locate snippets
# compare each point of all other points inside a window of length
# wl: compare the original array with new array rolling -wl/2, -wl/2+1,...,wl/2
# assume the point is x, must be the max of a window x-wl/2, x+wl/2
# input: 1-D array data, wl
# output: index specify the index of the extrema

# segment_data:
# excluding the end point

# apply_thresh:
# points which are within a window that is completely above threshold
# all points selected are above threshold with the window
# by binary search

# bug about segment_data?
